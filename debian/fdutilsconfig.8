.SH NAME
fdutilsconfig \- configure the suid bit of fdmount
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fdutilsconfig
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B fdutilsconfig
script provides an interactive way to configure the suid bit of 
the 
.BR fdmount "(1)"
binary.  It asks you some questions, give you a hint 
if needed, and enters your choice to 
.I /etc/fdmount.conf
file.
.PP
When upgrading the Debian fdutils package, the suid bit information stored in 
.I /etc/fdmount.conf 
is used to tell the new fdmount binary to keep your old suid bit settings. 
.PP
The script makes use of the
.BR suidmanager
Debian package, if it is installed.  If the script cannot find it, 
it manipulates the suid bit directly via `chmod u+s' command. 
.SH FILES
.B fdutilsconfig
reads and writes the configuration from /etc/fdmount.conf.  This file is
usually created when the fdutils package is installed for the first time.
Please don't edit /etc/fdmount.conf manually!  Use
.B fdutilsconfig
instead.
.SH NOTE
This script was written exclusively for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
It is not a part of the upstream fdutils sources.
.SH AUTHORS
.B fdutilsconfig
was adapted by Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org> from the
.B gnuplotconfig
script written by Tibor Simko <simko@debian.org>.
