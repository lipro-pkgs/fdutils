Default: false
_Description: Should fdmount be installed 'setuid root'?
 In order to enable ordinary users to mount a floppy disk,
 the fdmount program can be installed with the set-user-ID bit set, so
 that it will run with the permissions of the superuser.
 .
 Such a setting may have security implications in the case of
 vulnerabilities in fdmount's code.
